## Naive Bayes Classifier

- Features

  - data의 feature화: 특징 찾아내기

  - Simplify the classification and clustering problems
  - Turn objects(images, documents) into a set of numbers so that we can do computation over them
  - Function that signals a property of the input
    - Naive Bayes: features are random variables
    - Most classifiers: features are real-valued functions
  - Anything that you can write code to evaluate on an input

- Simple Classification

- Parameter Estimation

- Estimation:Smoothing 

- Train/validation/test: 80/10/10 or 70/10/20

- 에러 발생 시

### Summary

- Bayes rule allows diagnostic queries with conditional probabilities
- naive Bayes assumption takes all features to be independent given the class label
- Can build classifiers out of a naive Bayes model using training data
- Generalization: Smoothing estimates is important in real systems
